\begin{abstract}

Extreme rainfall on 12 August 2020 caused the Stonehaven Derailment,
    which resulted in three deaths.
This project applies current event attribution techniques for extreme rainfall events,
    finding probability ratios for the extreme rainfall to be 1.10 (1.06--1.15 90\% CI),
    1.37 (1.22--1.61) and 1.78 (1.46--2.34) for the 1980s, 2010s and in a 2K warmer world
    respectively over pre-industrial.

\textbf{Declaration}
\end{center}

I declare that this report is entirely my own work unless stated otherwise.

The introduction, chapter~\ref{ch:intro}, describes the motivations for the work.
This includes the information showing the impact of the extreme rainfall on the derailment by the Rail Accident Investigation Board~\cite{RAIB_2022},
    as well as my supervisor's paper analysing the effect of climate change on the risk of an extreme rainfall event~\cite{Tett_Soon}.

Chapter~\ref{ch:attribution} contains background material,
    with the first and third sections primarily relying on World Weather Attribution's methodology~\cite{van_Oldenborgh_et_al_2021},
    and the second section makes use of the information in Coles' textbook on the topic~\cite{Coles_2001}.

Chapter~\ref{ch:dev} consists of my own work,
    excepting the use of code and creation of equivalent diagrams to a currently approved but not yet published paper by my supervisor.
Code used in this project is given in~\cite{Me_Code},
    code used in my supervisor's paper is given in~\cite{Tett_Code}

Chapter~\ref{ch:results} is entirely my own work,
    using the same plotting techniques as in~\cite{Tett_Soon}.

Calculations used Python with many standard packages.

NumPy and XArray are used to manage and process both real and modelled rainfall data.

CartoPy is used to process data between both Ordinance Survey and Longitude-Latitude coordinate systems.

R and the RPy package are used to fit extreme value distributions to the rainfall data.
This calls the extRemes R package~\cite{extremes_R}.

The Rain Radar Data is taken from the Met Office's NIMROD system~\cite{radar_data}.

The Model Data is taken from the Met Office Hadley Centre's UKCP18 Convection-Permitting Model projections~\cite{model_data}.

Tht topography data on an OSGB grid is taken from~\cite{radar_topog}.

The data processing ran on both the JASMIN supercomputer and on my local machine,
GitHub was used to manage the transfer of both code and data.

The majority of the code used in this project is based on the code used by my supervisor performing a similar analysis on the 2021 Edinburgh cloudburst~\cite{Tett_Soon}.

\textbf{Personal Statement} % Use Git commits
\end{center}

I spent the first 2 weeks of the project retro-fitting the Edinburgh castle
library to apply to the Stonehaven crash.
This process began by creating plots including the
rainfall at the crash location on the day and an animation of the rainfall
in the Stonehaven region, allowing me to find an appropriate event definition.

For the remaining weeks of June, I implemented a topographical height mask
to the radar data, as well as establish a workspace to transfer data between
my laptop and the JASMIN supercomputer.

Following this I began my analysis of the radar data.
This involved computing and plotting the monthly rainfall maxima in
the Stonehaven region, as well as finding the quantiles of these extrema,
as well as using R to find the parameters of a GEV fit to both the empirical
and a monte carlo bootstrap of the rainfall distribution.

In mid-July, I created plots for these distributions and started to work with the Convection Permitting Model data,
    processing it as necessary to be appropriate for the use case.
This allowed me to create the time series to act as covariates to the CPM rainfall data,
    which were used in the first week of August to compute the probability ratios, intensity ratios and plots.
Any work done in August other than writing up the dissertation was spent analysing and critiquing the techniques used.

I started writing this dissertation in mid-July, and I spent the first
three weeks of August working on it full-time.

I have achieved the final outcome of probability ratios for the event and
    discussed the limitations of these results.

\begin{comment}
The Introduction should contain a description of your project and the
problem you are trying to solve. It should start off at a level that
should be understandable by anyone with a degree in physics, but it
can become more technical later

Where appropriate you should include references to work that has
already been done on your topic and anything else which lets you set
your work in context.

This is the place to put your conclusions about your work. You can
split it into different sections if appropriate. You may want to include
a section of future work which could be carried out to continue your
research.

The conclusion section should be at least one page long, preferably 2
pages, but not much longer.
