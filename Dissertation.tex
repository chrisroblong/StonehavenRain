\begin{abstract}

Extreme rainfall on 12 August 2020 caused the Stonehaven Derailment,
    which resulted in three deaths.
This project applies current event attribution techniques for extreme rainfall events,
    finding increases in likelihood for the extreme rainfall to be 10\% (6\%--15\% 5\%--95\% CI),
    37\% (22\%--61\%) and 78\% (46\%--134\%) for the 1980s, 2012--2021 and in a 2K warmer world
    respectively over pre-industrial.
These results are robust when the rainfall is defined as a one-hour event.

CartoPy is used to process data between both Ordinance Survey and Longitude-Latitude coordinate systems.

R and the RPy package are used to fit extreme value distributions to the rainfall data.
This calls the extRemes R package~\cite{extremes_R}.

\textbf{Personal Statement} % Use Git commits
\end{center}

I spent the first 2 weeks of the project retro-fitting the Edinburgh castle
library to apply to the Stonehaven crash.
This process began by creating plots including the
rainfall at the crash location on the day and an animation of the rainfall
in the Stonehaven region, allowing me to find an appropriate event definition.

For the remaining weeks of June, I implemented a topographical height mask
to the radar data, as well as establish a workspace to transfer data between
my laptop and the JASMIN supercomputer.

Following this I began my analysis of the radar data.
This involved computing and plotting the monthly rainfall maxima in
the Stonehaven region, as well as finding the quantiles of these extrema,
as well as using R to find the parameters of a GEV fit to both the empirical
and a monte carlo bootstrap of the rainfall distribution.

In mid-July, I created plots for these distributions and started to work with the Convection Permitting Model data,
    processing it as necessary to be appropriate for the use case.
This allowed me to create the time series to act as covariates to the CPM rainfall data,
    which were used in the first week of August to compute the probability ratios, intensity ratios and plots.
Any work done in August other than writing up the dissertation was spent analysing and critiquing the techniques used.

I started writing this dissertation in mid-July, and I spent the first
three weeks of August working on it full-time.

I have achieved the final outcome of probability ratios for the event and
    discussed the limitations of these results.

\chapter{Introduction}\label{ch:intro}

\section{Stonehaven Derailment}\label{sec:stonederail}

On the morning of the 12th of August 2020,
    after several hours of extreme rainfall,
    the 06:38 service from Aberdeen to Glasgow travels past Carmont,
    between Stonehaven and Montrose.
Due to a landslip reported ahead,
    the train reverses to return to Stonehaven.
On this journey,
    the train impacts debris washed out from a drain.
The train derails,
    resulting in three fatalities,
    with the other six passengers being injured.

As per the Rail Accident Investigation Branch report on the event~\cite{RAIB_2022},
    the extreme rainfall caused flows of surface water that the drain was unable to safely manage.
The RAIB report was created with the intention of preventing railway accidents by finding the causal
    factors contributing to the Stonehaven Derailment that are under the control of the railway
    and those associated with it.
Therefore,
    the report finds that the causal factors are that the drain was not designed to specification
    and that railway operations did not fully account for the risks posed by the extreme rainfall.
However,
    as the crash was caused by an extreme weather event,
    there is a potential additional human-driven causal factor, Anthropogenic Climate Change.

Due to the COVID-19 pandemic,
    the train had an extremely low loading of only 9 people.
Had this not been the case,
    it has been estimated (\cite{RAIB_2022} para. 461) that between 25 and 50 passengers would have been on the train,
    which had a capacity of around 300.
With this larger passenger loading,
    the derailment would have resulted a far higher number of casualties,
    although the potential number of casualties cannot be assumed due to the variability of casualty risk throughout the train.

A report released by the UK Government in the aftermath of the derailment~\cite{NR_DfT_2021}
    was made to discuss the resilience of the UK's rail infrastructure.
This report notes that the signal of climate change is becoming more significant,
    and dedicates a section to the impacts climate change will have on rail infrastructure.
It is with this consideration that the attribution analysis for the Stonehaven Event is performed here.

This analysis will proceed by considering the rainfall as the cause of the event.
As the modelling necessary for either the landslip or the drain debris washout are beyond the scope of this report,
    intensity of the extreme rainfall itself will be used to define the event.

\section{Rainfall in a warmer world}\label{sec:warmerrainfall}

It is reasonable to expect that climate change had an impact on the extreme rainfall on 12 August 2020.
One example of this in the UK is the estimated 40\% increase
    in the likelihood of one-day events as intense as storm Desmond~\cite{Desmond_2015}.
Another event in Scotland was the 2021 Edinburgh cloud-burst~\cite{Tett_Soon},
    which found an increase in likelihood of around 30\%,
    increasing to approximately 70\% after 2 Kelvin of warming,
    with the event spanning a 15-minute time period.
As the Stonehaven Event is in a similar climate to these two events,
    with a time period in between,
    sub daily but not sub-hourly,
    it would not be unreasonable to find similar results.

A warmer climate,
    through thermodynamic effects captured by the Clausius-Clapeyron relation,
    gives the air a greater saturation humidity,
    expected to scale by approximately 7\% per degree of warming~\cite{Fowler_2021}.
As the air is holding more water,
    the intensity of precipitation would be expected to scale similarly.

Working Group 1 of the IPCC~\cite{IPCC_2021} states that sub-daily precipitation intensities,
    such as that of the Stonehaven Event,
    would be expected to scale between one and two times that expected by Clausius-Clapeyron scaling.
This is as other properties of the event may also change in a warmer climate.
For example,
    if storms move slower in a warmer climate,
    the rainfall in locations under the storm would scale more greatly than saturation humidity,
    as the time that the location is exposed to the storm is lengthened.

The Introduction should contain a description of your project and the
problem you are trying to solve. It should start off at a level that
should be understandable by anyone with a degree in physics, but it
can become more technical later

Where appropriate you should include references to work that has
already been done on your topic and anything else which lets you set

This is the place to put your conclusions about your work. You can

\end{comment}
The probability ratios in table~\ref{tab:prtable},
    are taken as representing the change in the probability of the event.
Rendered as increases in likelihood,
    these give increases of 10\%, 37\% and 78\% for the 1980s, 2012--2021 and a 2K warmer world respectively.

It was discovered that using a lower quantile,
    closer to that of the rainfall at the Stonehaven Crash,
    of an event to define intensity could result in an increase likelihood.
From figure~\ref{fig:2probradarcpm},
    it is seen that using the 0.5 quantile definition would give an increase
    in likelihood of almost 200\% in a 2K warmer world.
It is therefore tempting to label the likelihood increases given above as underestimating
    the impact of Anthropogenic Climate Change.

However,
    as the original definition chosen was at a 0.95 quantile,
    these are the probability ratios that will be used.
This is done to prevent bias from a choice of definition that could over-inflate
    the impacts of warmer temperature,
    although this does not mean that repeating the analysis at the lower quantile would not be informative.

The area of this project where future work is most needed is on repeating the analysis
    with an empirical fit to 2-hour and 4-hour maxima,
    as the rainfall over the Stonehaven Crash location was over a 4-hour timespan
    and the rainfall at the location was found by the RAIB~\cite{RAIB_2022}
    to be rarest as a four-hour event.
In the RAIB report,
    it is stated that consultants were able to show that the event would not have happened
    had the drain which had a debris washout onto the tracks been built to specification.
This calculation likely involved the maximum safe throughput of the drain,
    which could then be used to determine the appropriate definition to be used.

Multiple takeaways,
    which may be useful in future event attribution studies
    which use the techniques in this paper,
    finding changes in model behaviour with increased temperature
    and applying those changes to a distribution of empirical events,
    were found.
Of note is that the most original insights were found through relatively straightforward mathematical analysis techniques.

Most simple of these is the use of a Taylor series to explain
    the equivalence of linear fits to saturated humidity.
On the other hand,
    the effective proof by contradiction of the invalidity of fitting the shape to a covariate and applying the
    scaling to the empirical fit could avoid similar choices from being applied in future analysis.

Most useful of these ideas was to break down the intensity for a given return period
    into the two parts defined by the location and the scale in the survival function.
This construction allowed the increase in intensity ratios over time to be understood as
