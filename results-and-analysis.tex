\section{Results}\label{sec:results}

\begin{comment}
This section should detail the obtained results in a clear,
easy-to-follow manner. It is important to make clear what are original
results and what are repeats of previous calculations or computations.
Remember that long tables of numbers are just as boring to read as
they are to type-in!

Use graphs to present your results wherever practicable.

Results or computations should be presented with uncertainties
(errors), both statistical and systematic where applicable.

Be selective in what you include: half a dozen \emph{e.g.}~tables that
contain wrong data you collected while you forgot to switch on the
computer are not relevant and may mask the correct results.

\subsection{Radar Data Fit}\label{subsec:radardatafit}

\begin{figure}[H]
    \centering
    \includegraphics[width=150mm]{radarreturnplot}
    \caption{A line graph plotting the return period in years against the intensity of the event,
        taken from fitting a GEV distribution to the event distribution.
    The dashed purple vertical line is the intensity of the Stonehaven event.
    The solid red vertical line is the actual one-hour rainfall maximum at the Stonehaven crash location.
    The grey area gives the uncertainties from a Monte Carlo bootstrap of approximately 1000 samples.}
    \label{fig:radarreturnplot}
\end{figure}

It was found that the maximum hourly rainfall at the crash location was 18.2mm/hr and
    that the empirical return period for the Stonehaven event was 17 years,
    as can be seen in figure~\ref{fig:radarreturnplot}.
The intensity of the Stonehaven event,
    the 0.95 quantile of the radar grid cells having their 2020 seasonal maxima in the AM of the 12th of August,
    was found to be 25.2mm/hr.

Figure~\ref{fig:radarreturnplot} was created using the survival function of the GEV distribution fitted to the event data,
    getting the return period as the reciprocal of the probability.
This had parameters location $\mu = 10.7$, scale $\sigma = 4.26$ and shape $\xi = -0.173$.

\subsection{Model Data}\label{subsec:modelcorr}

\subsubsection{Model Correlations}

\begin{figure}[H]
    \centering
    \includegraphics[width=150mm]{2cet_scatter}
    \caption{Scatter diagrams, from the Convection Permitting Model,
        for summer CET vs Stonehaven region saturated humidity (g/Kg) (a),
        Regional Temperature (b),
        Regional  Precipitation (mm/day) (c) and
        spatial median Rx1hr (mm/hr) for the region.
    The region is all points within a square of about 100x100km centered on the Stonehaven crash location.
    Colors indicate the ensemble number, black line is the best-fit regression slope.
    Text box shows best estimate and standard error in the estimated regression.
    Dotted black vertical lines show (left to right) CET summer mean for 1850--1899, 2021 and estimated CET at +2K warming.
    Title shows $R^2$ correlation coefficients for fit.
    Dotted vertical red lines show minimum and maximum CET values from 1850--2020 observations.}
    \label{fig:2cet_scatter}
\end{figure}

It is unsurprising that the correlations found in (a) and (b) are very similar,
    with both having $R^2$ values that round to the same number to the nearest percentage.
Some data points appear in almost identical points in both scatter diagrams.
This is evident from equation~\ref{eq:qsat}.
The by differentiating at $T=18$,
    equation~\ref{eq:qsat} has Taylor series to first order of $20.5627+1.2863(T-18)$.
By substituting $T=14$ and $T=22$ into this linear approximation,
    only small errors of $0.532$ and $0.603$ are found.
This suggests that in the CET range, equation~\ref{eq:qsat} is effectively linear and so the fit onto the Stonehaven Region saturated humidity
    is a linear scaling of the fit onto the Stonehaven Region Temperature.

\end{table}

The data in table~\ref{tab:0.95params} does not have a covariate shape,
    using the fixed shape parameter $\xi = -0.173$ from the empirical fit.
The shape parameter is in the $-0.174$--$-0.172$ range for all three fits with covariate shape,
    so it effectively duplicates the parameters here.

As the shape parameter is negative,
    it is possible to compute hypothetical the maximum,
    infinite return period intensity of an event using the formula $\mu - \frac{\sigma}{\xi}$.
This gives 32.7, 33.6, 35.9 and 39.0mm/hr as hypothetical maxima in
    PI, the 1980s, 2012--2021 and PI+2K Time Periods respectively.
